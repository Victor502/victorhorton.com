                <p>This is a portfolio project I did for myself. I wanted to showcase some of my talents. I used various methods to load pages. I incorporated JQuery plug-in's and Twitter's  Bootstarp. I developed with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. As a developer and designer you’re never finished with a website, there are always ways to make a website better or even stay with the trends.</p>

                <p>This was a project i did for a customer that wants to sell the clothing she no longer wears.  The though behind the website was so she could reach more people than at a yard sales.  She also wanted to use different social media sources so she could showcase clothing to people and have a place were they could see all of the clothing she had available.  This website uses Pay-pal's cart and checkout feature.  This allowed the customer to track the inventory and manage shipping. This site was developed with a few JQuery plug-in's, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</p>

                <p>This was a project i did for my CodeLouisville course. The theory behind it is to reach people that want to bring their home into the "smart home" revolution. I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I used Zurb’s Foundations framework as a starting point and added a JQuery plug-in for some interaction.  I made a contact page which included some PHP and a form validation to make sure all of the fields are filled out before allowing it to be sent.</p>

                <p>This was a project i did for a customer that wanted to have a place that his potential customers could see his work and reviews. I used images to showcase his work with various projects. This site is responsive and the view changes based on the screen size. This site was developed with HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
